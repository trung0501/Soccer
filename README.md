In the final of the world football championship, to end the score, people apply the penalty shootout as follows: 

Each team chooses five players in a certain order. Each player performed a penalty kick, this team player finished stone, it was the turn of the other team, and continued like that in the order of the defined players. 

If the match score after 10 penalties is still equal, this procedure will be repeated and if after the 20th penalty kick and the match score is still equal, the law of "unexpected death" will be applied, that is, the first team to score goals without being removed will be the team to win the Gold Cup. 

   a. How many different ratios can occur if the match ends after the first 10 penalties? 
   
   b. How many different ratios can occur if the match ends after the round of 10 penalties? 
   
   c. How many different ratios can occur if the match ends after performing no more than 10 penalties under the "Unexpected death" law?
